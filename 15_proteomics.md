Proteome: Protein complement expressed by a genome in certain environmental conditions at a given moment.

| Genome | Proteome |
| ------ | -------- |
| **Static**, it has the information | **Dynamic**, it carries out functions |

### From genes to cellular functions

    DNA -(transcription)-> RNA -(splicing)-> mRNA -(translation)-> Protein --> Function

**Complexity**:
- Diverse protein species per gene
- RNA processing
- Post-translational modifications (PTMs)
- Proteins have different physico-chemical properties
- Different extraction methods required
- Different sub-cellular locations
- Study of **subproteomes**

Systematic (large scale) study of protein properties to obtain a global, integrated view of disease processes, cellular processes and networks at the protein level:
- Expression levels
- Macromolecular interactions
- Post-translational modifications

**Proteomic technology**:
- Separation techniques (protein and peptides complex mixtures)
  - Mono- & Bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)
  - Multidimensional Chromatography (2DLC)
- Identification techniques (protein and peptide characterization)
  - Mass spectrometry (MS)
- Bioinformatics
  - Softwares and proteomics servers
  - DNA and protein databases

A mass spectrometer generates gas-phase ions from a sample, separating them according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and produces a record of their abundances.

- Protein mass it not enough for protein identification
- Proteins must be digested by proteases
- The exact mass of the peptides or fragments will be measured

**Identification methods**
- Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF)
- Trypsin digestion

**Experimental design: Non-gel proteomics**
1. Sample preparation
2. Digestion
3. Peptide separation (2DLC)
4. Identification (MS/MS)

**Expression proteomics**
- Detection of **changes** in the proteome in different environmental conditions
- Comparison and relative quantitation of the amount of protein- Different labeling can be used.

**Proteomics types**
- Quantitative proteomics: Analysis of protein expression at larger scale.
- Functional proteomics: Interaction proteomics and protein networks.
