## Research vs diagnosis

Biomedical research is not directed towards improving the participants' health.

## Actors

- Study subjects.
- Researchers.
- Sample repositories (biobanks).
- Collectors (clinics).
- Ethics committees.

    "Primum non nocere"

To access a biobank a project with scientific quality and ethics is needed.

## Informed consent
- Understanding capacity (the information).
- Decision capacity (the consent).

1. Conscious: finality, benefits / disadvantages.
2. Participation acceptance.
3. Revocation right --> **there must be a way to cancel an informed consent**.

## Data disassociation

- Anonymize (irreversible):
