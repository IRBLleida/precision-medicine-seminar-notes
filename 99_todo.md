__Summary of actions that, in my opinion, should be taken (regarding the KIRBHY platform) after having attended the course.__

- Include genomic / proteomic data into the KIRBHY database and not only a reference to the biobank entry.
- Open-source the platform to get recognition from the community.
- Deeply discuss the informed consent and privacy topics.
- Connect with existing genomics / proteomics databases and resources.
