__Summary of actions that, in my opinion, should be taken (regarding the KIRBHY platform) after having attended the course.__

- Include genomic / proteomic data into the KIRBHY database and not only a reference to the biobank entry.
- Open-source the platform to get recognition from the community.
- Deeply discuss the informed consent and privacy topics.
- Connect with existing genomics / proteomics databases and resources.

__ Interesting notes, in my opinion. __

- Pharmacoepigenetics: PharmGKB website (useful tool, specially in the design of research studies in this field ).
- GTEx or GENEVAR (GENe Expression VARiation): Databases to complement pharmacoepigenetics discussion.
- Angel Carracedo (genetic counseller expert, working in Santiago de Compostela) e-mail: **angel.carracedo@usc.es**.
- EGA (European Genome-phenome Archive) is a database project trying to collect all the available knowledle in the field.
- IBM's Watson Machine learning, based in Bayesian rules.  
- See **bioinfo.cipf.es** for computational-genomics useful tools.
- See **http://ibi.imim.es/befree**, text mining tool to check gene or variant published associations with diseases, and its associated R package **disgenet2r**.
- Courses on Bioinformatics, see: **http://bioinformaticsbarcelona.eu/training** (UdL is one of its members).
