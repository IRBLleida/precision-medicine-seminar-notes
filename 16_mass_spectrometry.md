**Proteomics: an analytical challenge**

There are no PCR-like techniques for proteins.

Proteomics is more complex than transcriptomics.

Protein levels are very different.

## What?
Highly precise determination of molecular masses of molecules and its aggregates.

## How?
Produces gas-phase ions of the molecules. Determines the mass/charge ratio of these ions through their interaction with electric, magnetic or RF fields.

> A mass spectrometer is a precision balance (scale) for molecules.
