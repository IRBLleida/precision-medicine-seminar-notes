# The human proteome project

- The price of sequencing a single genome has dropped from the $3 billion spent by the original Human Genome Project 15 years ago to as little as $700.

## What is the proteome?
- All **PROTE**ins expressed by the gen**OME** at a given time and specific conditions.
- Many variables affect the expression and activity of proteins: cell type, age, external stimuli, ...

> "The proteome is a fractal system; the more you go deep, the more you have to do"

## Proteomics Platforms
Translating genomes into cellular functions.

## Biomarker discovery pipeline
    Discovery > Verification > Clinical validation


## The present and future of proteomics in biomedicine
Some applications are already a routine in the clinics.
- Complete annotation of human proteome is mandatory.
- Dissemination and accessibility to the whole scientific community.
- New technical developments.

### [Human Proteome Organization](http://www.hupo.org)
**HUPO MISSION STATEMENT**
> To define and promote proteomics through international cooperation and collaborations by fostering the development of new technologies, techniques and training to better understand human disease.

#### [Human Proteome Project](https://hupo.org/human-proteome-project)
The Human Proteome Project (HPP) is an international project organized by the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) that aims to revolutionize our understanding of the human proteome via a coordinated effort by many research laboratories around the world. It is designed to map the entire human proteome in a systematic effort using currently available and emerging techniques. Completion of this project will enhance understanding of human biology at the cellular level and lay a foundation for development of diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, and preventive medical applications.
> **MISSION**
By characterizing all 20,300 genes of the known genome, the Human Proteome Project will generate the map of the protein based molecular architecture of the human body and become a resource to help elucidate biological and molecular function and advance diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
